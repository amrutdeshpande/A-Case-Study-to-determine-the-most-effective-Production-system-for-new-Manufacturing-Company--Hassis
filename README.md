# A-Case-Study-to-determine-the-most-effective-Production-system-for-new-Manufacturing-Company--Hassis
Hassis Games is a company which is set for the production of two board games Atlantic City and Reward. Having already known their yearly demand, the challenge is to access the situation and to determine the most effective production system to meet the deterministic demand of both the board games. In order to meet the yearly demand, the company needs to estimate several requirements. Firstly, it needs to estimate the machines required for all the individual component manufacturing by using its process times and the quantity of machines within a cell. In the due course the inventory levels of the components also has to be calculated. Secondly, the facility layout has to be designed by considering the given square footage of each machine, miscellaneous tools, storage, inventory and maneuvering space. The prorated financial cost of machine for a five year time period has to be keenly evaluated for a better layout. Finally, the labor cost has to be calculated by keeping changeovers, inventory management and material transfer tasks in the cost analysis. Additionally machine cost and facility cost must also be calculated in order to have an overall cost estimate of the company.
